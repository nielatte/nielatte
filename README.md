- âš¡ Fun fact: The term "computer virus" was actually coined in the 1980s by a researcher named Fred Cohen. But the first real virus, called Elk Cloner,
  was created by a 15-year-old in 1982. It infected Apple II computers and made a funny poem pop up after every 50th boot.
  Even though it wasnâ€™t harmful, it showed just how easily computers could be hacked, sparking the need for cybersecurity!
